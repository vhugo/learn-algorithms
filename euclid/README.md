# Euclid's Algorithm

Compute the greatest common divisor of two nonnegative integers `p` and `q` as follows: if `q` is 0, answer is `p`. If not, divide `p`  by `q` and take the remainder `r`. The answer is the greatest common divisor of `q` and `r`

*Exercise 1.1.24*: Give the sequence of values of p and q that are computed when Euclidâ€™s algorithm is used to compute the greatest common divisor of 105 and 24. Extend the code given on page 4 to develop a program Euclid that takes two integers from the command line and computes their greatest common divisor, printing out the two arguments for each call on the recursive method. Use your program to compute the greatest common divisor of 1111111 and 1234567.
